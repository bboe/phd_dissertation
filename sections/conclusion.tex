\chapter{Conclusion} \label{chap:conclusion}

As discussed in this dissertation, it is critical that we in the computer
science community do whatever possible to increase the number of new computer
scientists and prepare them for the challenges they must meet in industry,
education, medicine, science, and so on. The increase in enrollments in
response to job demand will impact all levels of the educational system. My
research contributes to this effort. First, I demonstrate the effectiveness of
static analysis in both the post-assessment of a Scratch-based \nth{4}--\nth{6}
grade summer camp and the development of a Scratch-based \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade
classroom curriculum. Second, I report on the submission behavior of university
computer science students in the presence of a real-time feedback and
assessment system. The significance of this collective research is to support
the growth in number of students who seek computer science education, and to do
so while maximizing student performance.

I envision a future where years from now, many students who complete our
primary school computer science related curriculum will ultimately choose a
college major that involves some degree of computational thinking. Their
university assignments will be electronically submitted, and designed
specifically to provide them with optimal feedback at the optimal time to
maximize their understanding in the least amount of time. Students of the
future will spend less time to learn more.

This evolution in student learning is possible only through analysis and
assessment of student in-progress work via studies similar to those I
performed. The iterative application and subsequent measurement of new and
altered techniques will not only advance computer science education at a
fundamental level, it will also make it possible to educate increased numbers
of computer science students without an increase in instructional
resources. The resulting cohort of well-educated computational thinkers with
shared knowledge and concrete skill sets will be able to solve more of our
real-world problems. I hope we will all see this future.
