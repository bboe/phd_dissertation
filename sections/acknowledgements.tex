The path to my Ph.D. was a long and tiresome one. I would have never reached
this point without the love, influence, and support from other people.

First and foremost, thank you Diana Franklin for taking me under your wing
these last few years. I certainly would not have reached this achievement
without your patience and guidance.

The loss of my brother nearly resulted in me giving up on completing my
Ph.D.. I would have done so without the generosity of Klaus Schauser who
mentored me and provided me funding through Appfolio, Inc. during the final
stage of my Ph.D.. Thank you Klaus, and thank you Appfolio, Inc..

Mom, thank you for providing me with the freedom to learn. Dad, thank you for
showing me how the world worked at an early age. You both influenced my
development of an inquisitive nature and desire to learn. Furthermore, thank
you for tolerating my breaking of the computer on a plethora of occasions.

Matt, Daniel (1988--2014), and Connor, thank you for being the best brothers
anyone could ask for. Buz, thank you for introducing me to HTML, and being a
great friend through all these years. Adam and Scott, thank you for the
camaraderie, support, and encouragement during our computer science
education. I am eternally grateful to have met such amazing friends to share my
first years away from home with. To all the guys of the GALAGA house, both past
and present, thank you for all the great events and outings.

Tim, thank you for organizing the 2004 programming battle and subsequently
mentoring me throughout my college education. Andy, thank you for the
encouragement and all the challenging tasks you entrusted to me at WorldViz,
LLC. Cha and Bob, thank you for convincing me to apply to the Ph.D. program by
attempting to discourage me from doing so. Janet and Peter, and Cheri and Tom,
thank you for the unrelenting support and confidence in my success. Thank you
to all my past teachers who challenged me and encouraged me to succeed.

Sharon and George, thank you for the love, the support, and all the delicious
home cooked meals over the last year. My new sisters, brothers, nieces,
nephews, aunts, uncles, and cousins, thank you making me feel welcome, for the
support when my brother died, and for the encouragement to finish.

Finally, Julie, my love, thank you for the incredible support during the final
year of my Ph.D.. I would not have made it through this last year without your
patience, understanding, and love. The next chapter of my life belongs to you.
