\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}
A recent study by code.org suggests that by 2020 there will be a one million
person gap in the United States between the number of computer science jobs
available and the number of people available to fill these jobs. Despite the
increase in enrollment in computer science undergraduate programs since 2008,
it is projected that the university system will not produce enough graduates
with computer science or related degrees to meet the demand.

This is a twofold problem. First, there is a depressing lack of computational
thinking related curriculum in primary and middle school. While many high
schools offer computer science courses, having just under 30,000 students
nationally take the AP Computer Science exam indicates a severe need for K--12
computational thinking curriculum reform. Second, the University system already
cannot handle the number of students applying to computer science programs,
thus turning away a significant number of people from an area they are severely
needed.

In this dissertation I describe methods that have a positive impact on solving
both the challenge to get more students interested in computer science, and the
challenge to support growth in the number of University students of computer
science.

\section{Thesis Statement}
The increase in interest in computer science has resulted in large demand for
computer science instruction, from primary school grades through undergraduate
level university programs. These two ends of the spectrum, however, are in far
different places in their development, with very little curriculum existing for
primary schools and very mature instruction available for
universities. Assessment automation can greatly enhance both efforts. At the
primary school level, assessment automation through static analysis of student
work can provide insight to student comprehension, thus permitting rapid
curriculum changes. This insight, however, is limited by the structure of
assignments and the amount of data collected. At the university level,
automated assessment can provide students with insight to their success on an
assignment allowing them to iteratively achieve mastery. However, the
timeliness and quantity of feedback may inhibit students' mastery of important
secondary processes.

\section{Dissertation Overview}
The remainder of this dissertation is structured as follows. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:hairball} we look at the use of static analysis to assist
with the \emph{post assessment} of five Scratch assignments given in a two-week
Scratch-based summer camp for \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade students. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:curriculum} we extend the use of static analysis of Scratch
assignments to aid in \emph{curriculum development} for \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade
classroom-based computational thinking education. Chapter~\ref{chap:feedback}
looks at \emph{submission behaviors} of university-level computer science
students in the presence of a real-time feedback and assessment
system. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} we summarize our findings and
discuss the impact of our research on computer science education in both the
primary and university instructional levels.
