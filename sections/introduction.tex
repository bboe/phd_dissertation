\chapter{Introduction}
TODO: Provide introduction to dissertation that lays out the next three
sections. Perhaps start by expanding on the current state of CS right
now. Describe the need to scale, and current interest in lower grades which
once successful may have a booming effect on college courses which is already
difficult.

\section{Motivation and Background}
TODO: Provide the motivation and background. I'm not really sure what to put
here. Is it even necessary?

\section{Thesis Statement}
The increase in popularity of Computer Science has resulted in large demand for
Computer Science instruction, from primary school through college. These two
ends of the spectrum, however, are in far different places in their
development, with very little curriculum existing for primary schools and very
mature instruction available for college. Assessment automation can greatly
enhance both efforts, albeit in different ways. At the primary school level,
assessment automation through static analysis of student work can provide
insight to student comprehension thus permitting rapid curriculum changes, but
this insight is limited by the structure of assignments and the amount of data
collected. At the collegiate level, automated assessment can provide students
with insight to their success on an assignment allowing them to iteratively
achieve mastery, however, the timeliness and quantity of feedback may inhibit
students' mastery of important secondary processes.

\section{Dissertation Overview}
This dissertation is structured as follows. In chapter~\ref{chap:hairball} we
describe our use of static analysis to assist with the post assessment of a
Scratch-based summer camp. In chapter~\ref{chap:curriculum} we further look at
static analysis of Scratch-based assignments in the context of near-real-time
curriculum development for primary school education. In
chapter~\ref{chap:feedback} we look at submission behaviors of college-level
Computer Science students in the presence of a real-time feedback and
submission system. Finally, in chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} we conclude.
