\chapter{Introduction} \label{chap:introduction}
A recent study by code.org suggests that by 2020 there will be a one million
person gap in the United States between the number of computer science jobs
available and the number of computer scientists available to fill these
jobs~\cite{codeorg:2013}. Despite an increase in enrollment in computer science
undergraduate programs since 2008, it is projected that the university system
will not produce enough graduates with computer science or related degrees to
meet this demand.

This lack of newly trained computer scientists is a twofold problem. First,
there are not enough students interested in computer science coming out of high
school. This is evidenced by the fact that of the 2.1 million students
nationwide who took an AP exam in 2013, only 31,000 (1.4\%) students took the
AP Computer Science exam~\cite{cb:2013}. This problem stems from the absence of
computer science related topics, such as computational thinking, in middle and
primary schools. Second, the university system already cannot handle the number
of students applying to computer science programs. University computer science
departments are thus turning away a significant number of people from an area
they are severely needed.

This dissertation describes methods I developed along with my colleagues that
have a positive impact on solving both the challenge to get more students
interested in computer science, as well as the challenge to support growth in
the number of university-level computer science students. I feel that this
work, in combination with future efforts, will help close the gap between the
number of newly trained computer scientists needed in the work force, and those
produced by the university system.

\section{Thesis Statement}
The increase in interest in computer science has resulted in large demand for
computer science instruction, from primary school grades through undergraduate
level university programs. These two ends of the spectrum, however, are in far
different places in their development, with very little curriculum existing for
primary schools and very mature instruction available for
universities. Assessment automation can greatly enhance both efforts. At the
primary school level, assessment automation through static analysis of student
work can provide insight to student comprehension, thus permitting rapid
curriculum changes. This insight, however, is limited by the structure of
assignments and the amount of data collected. At the university level,
automated assessment can provide students with insight to their success on an
assignment allowing them to iteratively achieve mastery. However, the
timeliness and quantity of feedback may inhibit students' mastery of important
secondary processes.

\section{Dissertation Overview}
The remainder of this dissertation is structured as follows. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:hairball} we look at the use of static analysis to assist
with the \emph{post assessment} of five Scratch assignments given in a two-week
Scratch-based summer camp for \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade students. In
Chapter~\ref{chap:curriculum} we extend the use of static analysis of Scratch
assignments to aid in \emph{curriculum development} for \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade
classroom-based computational thinking education. Chapter~\ref{chap:feedback}
looks at \emph{submission behaviors} of university-level computer science
students in the presence of a real-time feedback and assessment
system. Finally, in Chapter~\ref{chap:conclusion} we summarize our findings and
discuss the impact of our research on computer science education in both the
primary and university instructional levels.
