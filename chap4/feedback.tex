\chapter{Analyzing Student Submission Patterns in the Presence of a Real-Time
  Feedback and Assessment System}
\label{chap:feedback}

\def\currentprefix{feedback}

In the previous two chapters we looked at the benefits of using static analysis
to aid in the assessment of Scratch-based assignments. In the future, we would
like to provide these students with real-time feedback of their Scratch-based
assignments. However, little, if any, research has investigated how primary
school students would receive this sort of automated feedback. In the same
vein, little research has investigated the impact of automated feedback system
on college student submission behavior. In this chapter, we do precisely that;
we offer insights into the submission behavior of college students in the
presence of a real-time feedback and assessment system.
