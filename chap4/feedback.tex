\chapter{Analyzing Undergraduate Student Submission Patterns in the Presence of
  a Real-Time Feedback and Assessment System}
\label{chap:feedback}

\def\currentprefix{feedback}

In the previous two chapters we looked at the benefits of using static analysis
to aid in the assessment of Scratch-based assignments for \nth{4}--\nth{6}
grade students. In this chapter, we offer insights into the submission behavior
of university students in the presence of a real-time feedback and assessment
system. Many computer science departments are using such systems to handle the
growing number of computer science undergraduates because the assessment
portion of the system reduces the amount of work that an individual instructor
has to provide and thus makes it possible to increase enrollment
numbers. However, little research is available that has looked specifically at
how students interact with these systems and the subsequent impact on learning.
