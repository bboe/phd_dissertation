\chapter{Analyzing Undergraduate Student Submission Patterns in the Presence of
  a Real-Time Feedback and Assessment System}
\label{chap:feedback}

\def\currentprefix{feedback}

In the previous two chapters we looked at the benefits of using static analysis
to aid in the assessment of Scratch-based assignments for \nth{4}--\nth{6}
grade students. In this chapter, we turn to the submission behavior of
university students in the presence of a real-time feedback and assessment
system. Because these systems dramatically decrease the required assessment
time, many computer science departments are using them to handle the work
related to the growing number of computer science undergraduates. However,
little research is available that has looked specifically at how students
interact with these systems, or how these systems impact student learning.
