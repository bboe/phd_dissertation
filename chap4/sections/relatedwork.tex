\spacco{} analyzed over 37,000 snapshots from 96 students collected using the
Marmoset system. They correlated both starting early with better final scores,
and the length of a work session with score improvement. Marmoset's token
system was designed to encourage students to start earlier, however, the data
did not show significant evidence of students starting earlier in order to take
advantage of additional release tokens~\cite{Spacco:2013:TIP:2462476.2465594,
