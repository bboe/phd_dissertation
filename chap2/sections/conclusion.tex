\section{Conclusions and Future Work} \locallabel{sec:conclude}

We presented a case studying showing Hairball, a new static analysis tool that
provides an extendable framework for automatically analyzing Scratch programs.
In addition, we provide an initial set of plugins that analyze the
implementation of Scratch programs for competence in four areas:
initialization, broadcast and receive, say and sound synchronization, and
animation.  Our evaluation shows that Hairball is extremely useful in
identifying correctly implemented instances, with a false positive rate of less
than 0.5\%.  Overall, the mislabel rate of Hairball is less than half that of
manual analysis.  Therefore, we propose Hairball as an addition to, not
replacement of, manual analysis.

We have made the complete Hairball source code available under the open source
simplified BSD license. The source is hosted on github at
\url{github.com/ucsb-cs-education/hairball}.

Our future work entails writing Hairball plugins suitable for wide\-spread
summative assessment in both AP CS Principles courses, and other summer
camps. Finally we want to launch a web service that provides a convenient way
to utilize Hairball for formative assessment of individual Scratch projects.
