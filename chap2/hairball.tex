\chapter{Using Static Analysis to Assist with the Post-Assessment of a
  Scratch-based \nth{4}--\nth{6} Grade Summer Camp}
\label{chap:hairball}

\def\currentprefix{hairball}

In this chapter, we look at the significant role that static analysis plays in
the assessment of \sprogram{s} completed by \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade students
during a two-week Scratch-based summer camp. Scratch is a building-block
programming language designed for kids, which allows one to virtually create
programs in a manner similar to how one physically constructs structures with
LEGO\textregistered{}. Static analysis is a technique for automatically
analyzing computer programs to gain insights into their correctness, soundness,
and simplicity, to name a few. We apply static analysis to \sprogram{s} to gain
insight into student success with the camp's assignments, thus permitting us to
evaluate the effectiveness of the Scratch-based \nth{4}--\nth{6} grade summer
camp.
