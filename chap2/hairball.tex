\chapter{Using Static Analysis to Assist with the Post-Assessment of a
  Scratch-based \nth{6}--\nth{8} Grade Summer Camp}
\label{chap:hairball}

In this chapter, we look at the significant role that static analysis plays in
the evaluation of the overall effectiveness of our two-week Scratch-based
\nth{6}--\nth{8} grade summer camp. Static analysis is a technique for
automatically analyzing computer programs to gain insights into properties such
as correctness, soundness, and simplicity. Scratch is a building-block
programming language designed for kids which allows them to create programs in
a manner similar to how they would construct physical structures with
LEGO\textregistered{}. We apply static analysis to \sprogram{s} created by
\nth{6}--\nth{8} grade students in order to assess student success with camp
assignments.
