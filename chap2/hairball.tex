\chapter{Using Static Analysis to Assist with the Post-Assessment of a
  Scratch-based \nth{6}--\nth{8} Grade Summer Camp}
\label{chap:hairball}

In this chapter, we look at the significant role that static analysis plays in
the assessment of \sprogram{s} completed by \nth{6}--\nth{8} grade students
during a two-week Scratch-based summer camp. Scratch is a building-block
programming language designed for kids which allows them to create programs in
a manner similar to how they would construct physical structures with
LEGO\textregistered{}. Static analysis is a technique for automatically
analyzing computer programs to gain insights into properties such as
correctness, soundness, and simplicity. We apply static analysis to
\sprogram{s} to assess student success with camp assignments, permitting us to
evaluate the overall effectiveness of our Scratch-based \nth{6}--\nth{8} grade
summer program.
