Table~\localref{table:classes} details the eight \nth{4} grade, one \nth{5}
grade, and one \nth{6} grade classes from across California included in this
study. In all of these classes, we collected snapshots of the student created
\sprogram{s}. Additionally, in the first five classes, education researchers
both observed teacher instruction, and conducted student interviews.

In what we refer to as \emph{wave 0}, classes \emph{S0A}, \emph{S0B}, and
\emph{S0C} piloted the curriculum. This wave was used exclusively to test our
snapshot creation and collection procedure, as well as to test our ability to
disseminate the curriculum to instructors. \emph{Wave 0's} field notes and
snapshots are therefore not useful in comparison to classes of the subsequent
waves, and thus the data from \emph{wave 0} is not included in this chapter.

All classes, save for \emph{S2A}, were local. Education researchers accompanied
these local classes in order to assist teachers with the instruction of our
curriculum, and to help students with issues they experienced while completing
our assignments. The education researchers' presence in the classroom, along
with the field notes recorded following each visit, served as a form of
participant observation enabling us to become aware of concepts that were
difficult for the students to learn~\cite{spradley80}. In addition, for all
classes, we automatically generated and captured multiple snapshots of the
students' \sprogram{s}. We did this because prior work reported that the final
result of a student's development process does not accurately represent the
student's understanding of the
material~\cite{Piech:2012:MSL:2157136.2157182,brennan12}. The snapshot
generation, collection, and verification process is described in
Section~\localref{sub:collection}.

Once obtained, an analysis of the field notes resulted in an initial set of
student issues on the assignment. We manually inspected a sample of the
snapshots in order to both gauge the prevalence of each issue, and begin
defining a model for the detection of each issue. Additionally, we looked for
other unexpected student behavior that was not mentioned in the field notes,
such as the addition of new sprites, or the addition of scripts to sprites that
were not intended to be modified. Once we had a grasp on the issues encountered
by the students and how to detect them, Hairball plugins were written in order
to quantify the number of snapshots and/or students affected by each
issue. Finally, we met with the education researchers to discuss both the cause
of these issues, and what modifications could be made to our assignment, and
our Scratch programming environment in order to minimize occurrences of these
issues in future iterations of the assignment. This process is visualized in
Figure~\localref{fig:process}, and was repeated after both waves of classes.

  curriculum and our static analysis of \sprogram{s}.}

\subsection{Our Scratch Interface} \locallabel{sub:interface}
Prior work by Lewis showed that students using Scratch, ages 10--12, had less
confidence in their response to the statement ``I am good at writing computer
programs'' than students using Logo, a text-based language. Lewis hypothesized
that the students had not used all the blocks available within Scratch, thus
distorting the students' view of their
abilities~\cite{Lewis:2010:PES:1734263.1734383}. As part of our prior work, we
ran a two-week Scratch-based summer camp, during which we observed that
students of similar age to Lewis's were often distracted or overwhelmed by the
plethora of blocks available when the assignment only required use of a small
subset of them~\cite{Franklin:2013:SBO}. Furthermore, Halgren et al.\ reported
that children, ages 5--14, have a curiosity to explore available functionality
in their movie-making program:

\begin{quote}
Our kids quickly got themselves trapped in advanced paint and movie-making
modes which surpassed their expertise. They also loved clicking on the
character buttons at the bottom of the screen. Each click of a character button
placed a new character on the center of the
screen~\cite{Halgren:1995:AAM:223904.223974}.
\end{quote}

While young students' curiosity to explore is amazing, it can be a hindrance in
the classroom. Thus, in hope of minimizing both student confusion and student
distraction, and in attempt to focus students' attention and maximize their
programming confidence, we removed all unnecessary blocks from our Scratch
interface. For this assignment, the only blocks remaining for students to use
are:

\begin{itemize}
\item \glideDIST{} (and a variation that adjusted speed)
\item \emph{turn clockwise NUM degrees}
\item \emph{turn counterclockwise NUM degrees}
\item \pointDIR{} (where X is \emph{left}, \emph{right}, \emph{up}, or
  \emph{down})
\end{itemize}

\subsection{The Sequential Execution Assignment}
\locallabel{sub:sequential_execution}

In this study, we consider only the first assignment given to the three
\emph{waves} of classes. The high-level goal of this assignment was for
students to demonstrate competency programming a sequence of instructions that
accomplish the provided task. More specifically, the goals were for students
to:

\begin{itemize}
\item have confidence using the interface
\item recognize additional blocks are to be added to the provided base script
\item understand the importance of block ordering within a script
\item understand that execution occurs \netclicked{}
\end{itemize}

While the goals of the assignment in \emph{wave 0} were consistent with those
in the latter waves, the collected snapshots are inconsistent among \emph{wave
  0} students. Therefore, we will not discuss that iteration of the
assignment. However, the latter two waves of classes had their own iterations
of the sequential execution assignment, \sone{} and \stwo{}, which, we discuss
below.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=5.25in]{graphs/screen_s1.eps}
\caption{Depicts the initial screen for \sone{} including five sprites. Each
  student's task was to move the \net{} to \catch{} the \bear{}, the \horse{},
  and the \zebra{} in any order while avoiding the \snake{}. \stwo{} visually
  differs only by the absence of the \snake{}.}  \locallabel{fig:screen_s1}
\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Iteration 1: \sone{}} \locallabel{sub:s1}
The first iteration of the sequential execution assignment, referred to as
\sone{}, presents students with the \stage{} and five sprites arranged as shown
in Figure~\localref{fig:screen_s1}. In this assignment, the students are to
program the navigation for the \net{}, located in the upper left, such that it
\catch{es} the \bear{}, located in the upper right, the \horse{}, located in
the middle right, and the \zebra{}, located in the lower left. The students are
permitted to program the \net{} to \catch{} these sprites in any order they
desire. However, in \sone{}, the students are presented with an obstacle to
avoid, the \snake{}, located in the lower right.

\begin{figure}[!t]
\centering
\includegraphics[width=4.0in]{graphs/screen_blocks.eps}
\caption{Depicts the script and comments provided in the base-project to the
  students in \stwo{}. The script was the same in \sone{'s} base-project,
  however, the comments were not included.}
\locallabel{fig:initial_blocks}
\end{figure}

The students were provided with a base-project that moves the \net{} such that
it already \catch{es} the \zebra{} using a combination of \glideDIST{} and
\emph{point in direction X} blocks as depicted in
Figure~\localref{fig:initial_blocks}. In Section~\localref{sub:approach} we
classify this combination of blocks as an \textbf{orient and glide} approach
utilizing \abs{} orientation.

\subsubsection{Iteration 2: \stwo{}}
The second iteration, referred to as \stwo{}, presents students with a screen
similar to that of \sone{} (Figure~\localref{fig:screen_s1}). The only visual
difference is the removal of the \snake{}. Aside from needing to avoid the
\snake{}, both the students' objective and provided base-project remained the
same. However, in addition to the blocks included in \sone{}, we added two
other block choices:

\begin{itemize}
\item \pointtoward{}
\item \glideto{}
\end{itemize}

The \glideto{} block is a custom block we added to Scratch after observing
student difficultly during \sone{} with the two blocks required to successfully
move the \net{}. The students were not prompted to use either of these
blocks. A comparison of student block choices is provided in
Section~\localref{sub:approach}. One other notable change made to the Scratch
interface for \stwo{} was the removal of the \dce{} functionality provided by
Scratch. See Section~\localref{sub:dce} for a discussion of why we removed this
functionality.

\subsection{Capturing, Collecting, and Verifying the Accuracy of Snapshot Generation}
\locallabel{sub:collection}

Scratch, like many computer programs, only saves the most recent version of a
\sprogram{} when explicitly directed to do so via a \emph{save} action. In
order to obtain snapshots of students' in-progress \sprogram{s}, we modified
Scratch to automatically generate a snapshot when two conditions are met: the
\emph{green flag} button is clicked, and at least four modifications to the
\sprogram{} have occurred since the last snapshot. We create snapshots on
clicks of the \emph{green flag} button because these clicks are likely to occur
only when students have made incremental progress on their \sprogram{s} as
students were taught to test their \sprogram{s} in this manner. Snapshots are
also created whenever the student explicitly invokes the \emph{save}
action. All snapshots for a student are labeled by time, and combined in one
zip archive to reduce both the size and number of files we needed to collect.

We did not create a snapshot on every \emph{green flag} button click due to a
network issue we experienced during teacher training. The computers that we
trained the teachers on were configured such that \sprogram{} files were stored
on a remote server, thus each save required transferring data over the
network. While the creation of a single snapshot is not an issue, the
concurrent creation of many is. Because many school networks are configured
similarly, we introduced the four-modification snapshot creation condition in
hopes of preventing similar network issues; it worked.

Students were asked to submit their single snapshot archive at the end of each
work period by uploading the file through a web service we wrote for collection
purposes. This web service associated students with their uploaded
snapshots. While this process was very effective, and much less error prone
than the researchers manually fetching files from computers, it was not without
issue; there were three:

\begin{enumerate}
\item A few students accidentally submitted the snapshots of a student who had
  used the same computer in a previous class due to the web browser's recall of
  the directory of the last uploaded file.
\item Instead of starting with the provided base-project, a few students
  accidentally started with a snapshot of a student who had used the same
  computer in a previous class.
\item Some students submitted only the most recent snapshot due to selecting
  the final version file rather than the snapshot archive file.
\end{enumerate}

Fortunately, we were able to utilize the save-log contained within each
\sprogram{} file (i.e., our snapshots) to identify students who experienced any
of these three issues. The save-log in a \sprogram{} file records the history
of every \emph{save} action with a timestamp and the name of the file saved to,
providing us with an expected number of snapshots for each
student. Additionally, from this information we identified students sharing
unexpected common starting points. That is, students who share more than one
consecutive entry in their \sprogram{s'} save-logs that immediately succeeds
the save-log of the \sprogram{} we provided the students to start with. Once
identified, we disassociated these snapshots from the student in the
chronologically later class. This procedure was used to resolve issue~\#1 and
issue~\#2. Furthermore, we retroactively obtained the snapshots for some of the
students affected by issue~\#1. We resolved issue~\#3 by comparing the number
of snapshots collected for a student to the actual number of snapshots created
as indicated by the save-log. Students for whom we did not have all snapshots
were removed from our dataset. Due to the fact that we did not analyze any of
the \emph{wave 0} classes, we did not validate the data for those classes. Thus
the \emph{student} and \emph{snapshot} values for the first three columns in
Table~\localref{table:classes} are an upper bound.
