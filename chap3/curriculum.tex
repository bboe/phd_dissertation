\chapter{Using Static Analysis to Assist with the Development of a
  Scratch-based 4th-6th Grade Curriculum}
\label{chap:curriculum}

\def\currentprefix{curriculum}

In the previous chapter, we detailed the role that static analysis has in the
post-assessment of Scratch-based assignments. We showed that static-analysis
assisted assessment both by reducing the speed of assessment, and by improving
the accuracy of assessment. In this chapter, we expand on the use of static
analysis of Scratch assignments, this time in the context of curriculum
development. We describe leveraging feedback from static analysis in order to
rapidly iterate and verify changes made to a \nth{4} -- \nth{6} grade
curriculum.
