\chapter{Using Static Analysis to Assist with the Development of a
  Scratch-based 4th-6th Grade Curriculum}
\label{chap:curriculum}

\def\currentprefix{curriculum}

In the previous chapter, we detailed the role that static analysis has in the
post-assessment of Scratch-based assignments. We showed that static analysis
assisted assessment both by reducing the speed of assessment, and by improving
the accuracy of assessment. In this chapter, we expand on the use of static
analysis for the assessment of Scratch assignments; this time, in the context
of curriculum development. We describe leveraging feedback from the static
analysis of student made \sprogram{s} in order to rapidly iterate, test, and
verify changes made to a \nth{4} -- \nth{6} grade curriculum.
