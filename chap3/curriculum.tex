\chapter{Using Static Analysis to Assist with the Development of a
  Scratch-based \nth{4}--\nth{6} Grade Classroom Curriculum}
\label{chap:curriculum}

\def\currentprefix{curriculum}

In the previous chapter, we detailed the role that static analysis plays in the
post-assessment of Scratch-based \nth{6}--\nth{8} grade summer camp
assignments. We showed that the use of static analysis increased both the speed
and accuracy of assessment. In this chapter, we describe our work that extends
the application of static analysis from a summer camp context to the context of
\nth{4}--\nth{6} grade classroom curriculum development informed by
design-based research. Using feedback from static analysis of student-created
\sprogram{s} we direct changes to both the Scratch interface and the
assignments that make up our curriculum. We found that static analysis helps
reduce the time to complete the analysis portion of the curriculum development
cycle.
